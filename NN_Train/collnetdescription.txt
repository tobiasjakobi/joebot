Create a Feedforward NeuralNet
with 3 layers
3 neurons on layer #0
3 neurons on layer #1
1 neurons on layer #2
and that's all about the basic topology
Set the bias of neuron 0 on layer 0 to 0.000000
Connect neuron 0 on layer 0 with neuron 0 on layer 1 with 0.089985
Connect neuron 0 on layer 0 with neuron 1 on layer 1 with 2.160398
Connect neuron 0 on layer 0 with neuron 2 on layer 1 with -0.187618
Set the bias of neuron 1 on layer 0 to 0.000000
Connect neuron 1 on layer 0 with neuron 0 on layer 1 with -0.570984
Connect neuron 1 on layer 0 with neuron 1 on layer 1 with 0.715427
Connect neuron 1 on layer 0 with neuron 2 on layer 1 with -0.612794
Set the bias of neuron 2 on layer 0 to 0.000000
Connect neuron 2 on layer 0 with neuron 0 on layer 1 with 1.806571
Connect neuron 2 on layer 0 with neuron 1 on layer 1 with -0.157420
Connect neuron 2 on layer 0 with neuron 2 on layer 1 with 2.155664
Set the bias of neuron 0 on layer 1 to 1.274111
Connect neuron 0 on layer 1 with neuron 0 on layer 2 with 0.935178
Set the bias of neuron 1 on layer 1 to 0.777270
Connect neuron 1 on layer 1 with neuron 0 on layer 2 with -1.393603
Set the bias of neuron 2 on layer 1 to 0.739181
Connect neuron 2 on layer 1 with neuron 0 on layer 2 with 1.723929
Set the bias of neuron 0 on layer 2 to -1.184349
and that was the whole net :D
