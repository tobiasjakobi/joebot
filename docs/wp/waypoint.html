  :</b></font></p></u>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Waypoint files 
  ( *.wpj ) contain the knowledge of each bot of a map. The Joebot is able to 
  play CS without waypoints, but it'll just run to the next wall and follow the 
  wall . A good waypoint file is therefore the basis for a good CS - match.<br>The bots will navigate the map with their primary goal based on waypoints but also rather short distance actions like seeking cover are based on waypoints. Sometimes even grenade throwing is at least partly based on waypoints. Therefore not only a good coverage of the map for <i>large scale</i> navigation is needed, but also <i>hiding places</i> behind crates are useful to waypoint.

<p><br>
  Till now all the waypoint stuff has to be done manually except adding starting 
  points. In the next time, I'll try to implementate a system, which can learn 
  the map.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Autowaypoint on : </b>This 
  function automatically adds waypoints when the nearest waypoint is at least 
  200 Units away ( on ladders 75 units ). It'll automatically add paths between 
  waypoints u went from to. Jump waypoints will automatically be added when u 
  jump. So be careful with jumping while autowaypointing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ladder waypoints :</b> 
  The bots will have less problems when u place at least two waypoints on the 
  ladder. One at each end, waypoint in between can be added as well. No matter 
  if <i><b>autopath</b></i> is on or off, ladder waypoints will not automatically 
  be connected. You have to connect them manually using the <b><i>pathwaypoint 
  create1</i></b> and <b><i>pathwaypoint create2</i></b> commands, or you just 
  can run along the waypoints on the ladder and paths will be automatically added 
  when autowaypoint is on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>dontavoid waypoints :</b> 
  When the bots wanders throught the map, it'll avoid walls, to avoid getting 
  stuck in doors, e.g.. This feature isn't useful when the bot should climb on 
  boxes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>dontavoidfall waypoints 
  :</b> The bots have an internal system which avoids falling down somewhere. 
  But there may be situations where you don't want this ( holes in a roof where 
  u want to get thru e.g.) . Then you can set this flag to the related waypoints.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>reset waypoints : </b>Reset 
  waypoints are some kind of temporal solution for a shitty problem. When a bot 
  falls down somewhere it takes some time till he realizes, that he cannot reach 
  the next waypoint. To force the bot to stop trying every time the nearest waypoint 
  to it has to be a reset waypoint. Then it resets the index of the next waypoint 
  and tries to get a new one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Aiming waypoints :</b> 
  When a bot is snipering, it'll look to all visible waypoints one after another. 
  When you want to force the bot to look somewhere else, too, but you don't want 
  to place there a waypoint which can be also used for navigation, or where such 
  a waypoint is stupid ( high in the air ) aiming waypoints can be useful.</font></p>
<u><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Information on Autowaypointing and advanced movement system ( movement recording ) :</b><br><br></u>
Normally you can waypoint using <i>waypoint add</i> and/or <i>autowaypoint on</i>. If you use <u>autowaypointing</u>, it's often useful to switch off automatic path creation via <i>autopath off</i>. A basis for waypointing are often the <u>standard locations</u>, being waypointed by <i>waypoint addstdwp</i>.<br>
The quality of autowaypointed waypoints for a map doesnt have to be worse than the manually created ones, but there is the danger of just running around with autowaypoint on and calling that waypointing and presenting these so called waypoints to others. But waypointing is somewhat more, you have to observes the bots playing, place some sniper waypoints ( although this might sometimes be also detected by the bots itself, but why shouldn't we help them :) ), place some dontavoid waypoints when a bot should run near a wall. Advanced movements take even more time to debug ( usage is <i>debuggoal</i> is reasonable ! ).
<br>
Navigation problems of bots are often also based on bad waypoints. The most visible problems are sometimes on cs_ maps when you forgot to place a rescue point waypoint somewhere.
<br>
<br>
If you want the bots to reach places which are difficult to reach, you can use normal <u>jump waypoints</u> or jump waypoints with recorded movements. When you switched on autowaypointing <u>advanced jump waypoints</u> also containing these recorded moves will be added when you jump and if they are really necessary. The test which is done if this jump was necessary is sometimes a bit conservative, so you can override the test by <i>autowaypoint testjump off</i>. This test is mainly useful when you have switched on <u>autowaypointing for all players</u> ( <i>autowaypoint all/human</i> ) and you cannot control where and when they are jumping.<br><br>
Of course this automatic adding of jump waypoints can be <u>switched off</u> by <i>autowaypointaddjump/awpaj on/off </i> ( awpaj is an abbreviation ) and sometimes you just don't want advanced movements as long as they are sometimes causing some <u>strange effects</u> like bots in boxes, so you can switch this off, too and just add normal jump waypoints if enabled : <i>advancedmovements/advm on/off </i>. ( advm is again an abbreviation )<br><br>
<u>The maximum of recordable movements</u> is almost unreachable, it's as high as the maximum number of waypoints, at the moment that's 4096. The maximum duration of a ADVM is 2 seconds, the frequency of recording is 10 Hz, just for information.<br>
