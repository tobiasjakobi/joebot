  1. 
    Everybody talks about the console ... how do I get there ?</i></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First you 
    should start Halflife with the parameter &quot;-console&quot;. If you have 
    a shortcut for halflife, counterstrike or DoD, just right click on it and 
    select properties. There you'll find an edit box containing the name of the 
    executable. <i>( for example : &quot;c:\sierra\half-life\hl.exe&quot; )</i> 
    Now you just add &quot;-console&quot; there, that you get <i>&quot;c:\sierra\half-life\hl.exe 
    -console &quot;. </i>If you have a shortcut for Counterstrike for example 
    it should then look like<i> &quot;c:\sierra\half-life\hl.exe -game cstrike 
    -console&quot;. </i>When all this is done, you can access the console from 
    within the game with the '^'-key, i.e. left of the &quot;1&quot;.</font></p>

  2. 
    When I start a Multiplayer game all slots are filled up one after the other 
    by bots. But I want to have a free slot and they'll even come &quot;back&quot; 
    when I kick one !</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
          look in your cstrike/joebot/bot.cfg file. There you'll find an entry 
          called &quot;max_bots&quot;. Set this value to 0 and no bot will appear 
          automatically.</font></p>

		3. 
          I started a multiplayer game, but there are no other players ... what's 
          wrong ?</i></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
          no bots are added automatically, you have to add them manually by typing 
          &quot;addbot&quot; in the console. Then a bot will be added. For further 
          information take a look at the readme.</font></p>

		4. 
          I already tried addbot, but then I always get the message that this 
          is an unknown command ?!</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          looks like the installation hasn't been really successful. Have you 
          really selected your halflife directory for installing JoeBOT ?</font></p>

          The bots are running through the maps, but they seem to fly, the legs 
          are funny spread to the sides ! What did JoeBOT do to my beloved halflife 
          ?</i></b> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JoeBOT 
          did nothing to your halflife. Just make sure you have the newest 
          version of Halflife, at least 1.1.0.4, for CS1.1 at least 1.1.0.6</font></p>

          I like to play as a counterterrorist against a whole team of terrorists. 
          I already managed it to add only terrorist bots (&quot;addbot 1&quot;) 
          , but after some rounds, some of them change to my team. What do I have 
          to do to avoid this ?</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
          open your console and type &quot;mp_autoteambalance 0&quot; and &quot;mp_limitteams 
          0&quot;. Now you won't have this problem anymore. If you want to change 
          this variables in every game, you can also just add this 2 commands 
          to ur cstrike/autoexec.cfg</font></p>

		7. 
Do Flashbangs and Smokegrenades affect the bots ? ... and how ?</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yes, 
          the bots are affected by both types of grenades, flashbangs and smokegrenades. 
          After a flashbang attack they won't see anything for some time, this 
          is very similar to the effect on human players. Higher skilled bots 
          will try to shoot where they have heard or seen an enemy before being 
          blinded.<br>
          The effect of smokegrenades is faked. It's _really_ difficult to detect 
          all the single smoke puffs, therefore it's seen as a plane of smoke 
          in which the grenade lies. If the enemy bot is behind a smoke grenade, 
          it won't be able to detect you instantly, you have appr. 4 seconds to 
          run in the sight of an enemy behind a smokegrenade without being detected. 
          But of course the radius of the grenade is limited and you'll be detected 
          almost instantly by muzzle flashs, i.e. when you shoot yourself, no 
          matter what direction. ( btw, this is the same with being prone in DoD, 
          but the time of not being detectable is configurable in bot_skill.txt 
          ) </font></p>

          How can I run <a href="http://www.metamod.org">metamod</a> with JoeBOT 
          ?</i></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>First 
          : It is possible to run JoeBOT with Metamod :-)</i><br>
          ok, now how to do this : first you install JoeBOT, then you install 
          Metamod. You might have noticed now, that you got the functionality 
          of Metamod, but you cannot get the Bots. So why ? <br>
          The Answer is simple : Metamod is now between the game and the mod - 
          dll, the place the bot - dll normally has. Therefore we somehow gotta 
          tell Metamod, that it should load the joebot.dll into this dll chain 
          as well. We do this by adding a command to the commandline when starting 
          hl ( how to do this ? take a look at the question about the console 
          :) ) : It's &quot;+localinfo mm_gamedll ../joebot/joebot.dll&quot; ( 
          of course without the quotes ). The same for the linux ppl, you only 
          have to replace the .dll with .so.<br>
          Easy, isn't it ?!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
          if you still have problems, sometimes you need to move the .dll or .so 
          from the hlds/joebot to the hlds/cstrike/joebot folder for example. 
          Then you also need to remove the ../ in the commandline at the localinfo 
          commandline command.</font></p>

          How to run JoeBOT with <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/botman/">botman</a>'s 
          <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/botman/botmixer.shtml">BotMixer5000</a> 
          ?</i></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
          you should install all the bots you wanna use together in one game. 
          Then you install the BotMixer by botman, go to the half-life/botmixer 
          folder and execute the install.bat file in the respective folder.<br>
          Now you go to your cstrike/ folder and edit the botmixer.cfg. There 
          you have to define where to find the dlls ( or the .so for the linux 
          ppl again ). Botman obviously wasnt careful when creating the line for 
          the joebot, it has to be &quot;joe ../joebot/joebot.dll&quot; there 
          of course ( again, without the quotes ! ).<br>
          If you want to deinstall botmixer before installing another bot, e.g., 
          please deinstall it with the deinstall.bat file from the botmixer folder, 
          otherwise you'll have serious problems, because when installing botmixer, 
          some files have to be renamed, and if you are not 100% sure what's done, 
          leave this work to the batch files, and you can become old with your 
          halflife installation.<br>
          Of course you can also install a bot without deinstalling botmixer, 
          but then, take a look at the cstrike/liblist.gam before installing the 
          bot, make a copy for example, and then restore it after the installation 
          of the bot.<br>
          <i><b>Metamod + BotMixer : </b></i>Hey, that's possible as well :D. 
          Just install everything as usual without metamod, then install metamod, 
          and do the same as with the normal metamod installation and one bot. 
          But the commandline has to be modified, now you shouldnt point to a 
          bot - dll, but to the botmixer.dll in the cstrike/dlls folder.<br>
          <i><b>Problems with BotMixer : </b></i>My game always crashes when I 
          try to play joebot with the botmixer. Why ? --- Well, get the newest 
          version of joebot and everything will be cool dude ! <font size="-2">( 
          at least I hope so, nobody's perfect )</font></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>Why 
          is this bot called JoeBOT ? That name doesn't sound very creative !</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LOL, 
          no it's not at all creative. When I began writing my bot, I wanted to 
          call it NNBot, but then some weeks later I realized that there was already 
          a bot called NNBot. So I decided to name it temporarily JoeBOT, derived 
          from my real name, Johannes. And till now it hasn't been changed ....</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>Hey, 
          stupid names you got there for your bots ... Miststueck, Karla, etc. 
          .... WTF is that ?</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*g* 
          First only some ppl from my school knew JoeBOT. The names are all nicknames 
          for pupils from my class or teachers.</font></p>
