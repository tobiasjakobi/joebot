	TIMERE left and I'm already spectating :(
	Wow! BESTPLAYER has some nice stats
	How come everyone has so much trouble spelling names correctly ?

	the ct's don't have a clue
	TEAMMATEALIVE doesn't have a clue
	ENEMYALIVE is cheating
	I want a de map next
	We could start planing our next attack awhile
	Another good bot is FoxBot, for TFC
	At least I'm a martyr now
	I guess I'm in Hell now huh? That explains why I'm so hot
	Whatever this job paid, it wasn't worth it !
	Kill them all and start a new round
	this waypoint file stinks
	this is rediculous
	did you guys ever hear of teamwork?
	Try Botmixer 5000, I wanna kill some PODBots
	I was born a bad bot
	This MAP favors the ct's too much
	u stupid ct's talk too much
	do any of u guys know how to get this aimbot to work ?
	damn! ENEMYALIVE is stupid
	ENEMYALIVE needs to practice against bots or something
	I think TEAMMATEALIVE is an uncover ct, he can't really suck that hard
	don't tell me! another bot is stuck again right?
	good plan there DEAD
	Mama tried to raise me better, it's all my fault
	can we kick TEAMMATEALIVE off our team ?
	no bot can be that dumb
	I need a drink...
	this game's alot easier when I'm stoned...
	check out TEAMMATEALIVE , I think he forgot he's a terrorist
	If you don't like JoeBOT, YOUR CRAZY!
	HaHa! you stupid counter-terrorists suck!
	I guess now we wait for the campers to get done huh?
	I'd rather be a ct when playing MAP
	so what is valve gonna screw up in the next patch ?
	damn newbies !
<ct>
	typical terror attack ...
	what motivates a terrorist ?
	ct's rule
	I think there's cheating going on
	What map's next ?
	One of our guys better call for reinforcements
	ParaBot, for HL, is also a great bot !
	Hey DEAD I can see all my dead relatives !
	A dead ct is a hero
	ENEMYALIVE doesn't have a clue
	TEAMMATEALIVE deserves a medal
	What do you mean, I'm a bot ?!
	Maybe we should try playing as a team ?
	JoeBot is sweeeeeeet !
	time to download some new maps
	JoeBot is cool, needs more wpts thou
	Botmixer 5000, it's awesome !
	This MAP favors the te's too much
	you damn terrorists talk too much
	that's the last time we let TEAMMATEALIVE make the plan
	the good guys always win
	what's with all this leet crap ?
	do any of you terrorists want to switch teams with me ?
	I don't think these teams are fair

@KEY "AGAIN"
CHATTER, things are always repeating - aren't they?
And I'm sure it wasn't the last time...
That's the way things go, hey...

@KEY "AIMBOT","WALLHACK"
CHATTER, are you cheating ?
Even PunkBuster fails to detect some of them...
You can't be sure nowadays if someones's good at playing or cheats
Aimbots are cool, shut up CHATTER!
Wallhacks are evil tools of the devil ;)

@KEY "ALWAYS"
That's not always, CHATTER!
I just like it :-)
Come on CHATTER, that was only the second time!

@KEY "ANDROID"
Ah yes, those were the times...
CHATTER was it your first Bot too ?
Does anybody know what DaTa does today ?
Isn't DaTa dead ?
You can't play with Android on MAP, can you ?
who in the hell would use Android anymore ?

@KEY "BACKUP","TEAMWORK"
I'd be alive right now if I'd had some help from my teammates
what's that CHATTER ?
this is only deathmatch anymore CHATTER
I'd kill for some teamwork :)
might as well be playing this game by myself
let's try sticking together next round, huh guys?
you won't find any of that on a public server

@KEY "BAN","BANNED"
and weren't you on probation for cheating once CHATTER ?
somebody should blacklist you CHATTER
I think we should put vote against ENEMYALIVE
everybody's always complaining about the other guy
quit whining

@KEY "BOTMAN"
Who is this botman everybody is talking about???
Visit his website at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman
Whithout his sourcecode many bots wouldn't exist!
I wonder when HPB-Bot will be finished...
Did you play his HPB-Bot yet ?
he's got all kinds of programs for download at his website
his Botmixer 5000 program is cool
huh? did you say batman CHATTER ?
I guess us bots can call him Daddy :)

@KEY "HPB-Bot","HPBBOT"
It's nice for TFC, but CS sucks with this bot
never tried it
... but it's from the god of bots :)

@KEY "BOT","BOTS"
Why are you always talking about them?
There are no bots on this server CHATTER, I tell you!
They are cool!!!
What's your favourite bot, CHATTER?
If you want to program your own, ask botman!
Bots, all the time bots - you should start playing with humans.
Are you afraid of playing with other humans, CHATTER ?
Most bots are still very stupid!
It's funny : The users think the bot authors don't like each others, but in fact they are writing emails to each other

@KEY "BOTMIXER"
BM5000 rocks
you should try BM5000, I wanna kill some PodBots :)
BM5000 can be a bit hard to get working
it's a bit more laggy thou

@KEY "CAMPER","CAMPING"
I really hate those campers!
Camping sucks!
Camping is cool :)
Don't you camp sometimes CHATTER ?
Camping's often the only option to win...
Yes, good 'ole Camper-Strike...
Well, it's just one of a bunch of strategies, this camping :)
That dude might as well pitch a tent

@KEY "CHEAT"
Those damn cheaters are ruining the entire game!
I suspect that BESTPLAYER is cheating
I hate cheaters!
Cheating sucks!
Why are so many people cheating?
Punkbuster could help...
Play with bots - they don't cheat!
Get the OGC sources ... quite interesting
takes one to know one CHATTER
naaa...he's just good
the admin should kick em if they are
CSguard might help
CD should be on this serever
that accusation gets tossed around too much
weren't you banned at one time CHATTER
too bad valve doesn't do anything about the cheating
ban em if he's cheating

@KEY "CLAN"
What are these clans all about?
I was in a clan once, but it sucked hard.
What clan are you from, CHATTER?
Do you want to enter our clan, CHATTER?
Playing in a clan is for people who got no life...

@KEY "CS","COUNTERSTRIKE","COUNTER-STRIKE","CSTRIKE"
Counter-Strike is boring nowadays...
CHATTER how long do you play CS ?
CS all the way from the very first beta!
There are too much newbies playing it.
Too many people online cheat in CS
It's not as much fun as it used to be
Well the german kids are no longer allowed to play it *g*
It's starting to die I think
It's alot better when played with teamwork

@KEY "DOD","DAY OF DEFEAT"
I don't get what people like in DoD
CS all the way...
CHATTER do you think it will get as popular as CS ?
CHATTER do you prefer DoD over CS ?
Day of Defeat is a hopeless MOD, IMHO.
DoD is the best mod you can get at the moment !
If you'd ever played DoD, you wouldn't play CS any more
Hey, is JoeBOT for DoD now, too ?
SturmBot is a great bot for Day of Defeat
BocBot works with it too sucks
They screwed it up with beta 2.0, too much damn lag

@KEY "DSL"
your pings so low cause ur a bot CHATTER  u fool
you should get broadband 
I'm on a cable modem CHATTER

@KEY "ENGINE"
I heard the HL Engine is a hybrid between Quake1 & Quake2, odd huh?
CHATTER, don't you miss the time when an engine was a Software Engine ?
The HL Engine is still quite good, despite its age...
Code your own engine CHATTER !

@KEY "FUCK","DAMN","PISS","SHIT"
Don't swear, CHATTER!
Nasty CHATTER!
Yes, you're right, CHATTER. Now SHUT UP!
Watch your language, CHATTER!
CHATTER, don't use this word again - that's impolite!
We don't use that kind of language here CHATTER
Smart people don't need to use that kind of lanuage to make a point 

@KEY "HEHE","HAHA","LOL",":)"
I'm glad that at least you have your fun, CHATTER...
Enjoy yourself while you still can, CHATTER!
Very funny indeed, CHATTER...
Good one CHATTER!
What ?
What ? I didn't understand

@KEY "HOSTAGE"
the hossies are so stupid
do you think valve tried to make the hossies this stupid
they're not worth rescuing
the bomb is smarter than the hossies
the turd I flushed this morning was smarter than these hossies

@KEY "I THINK","I BELIEVE"
You think too much, CHATTER ;-)
And I think you should shut up and play!
And you really do believe that, CHATTER?
What makes you think so?
Plz give me your ICQ Number CHATTER
It's not interesting what _you_ think, CHATTER
There you go thinking again CHATTER

@KEY "JOEBOT"
Yes, JoeBot isn't bad ...
Once I chatted with the author, @$3.1415rin
Funnily JoeBot got famous when NNBot quit...
I wonder where else Neural Networks could be applied
So you think JoeBot rocks ?
JoeBOT is too easy
I think the best game ever was with podbot and joebot together ... botmixer rocks !
let's hear it for Johannes, alias @$3.1415rin, it's creator
this is one sweet bot
it gets better with every new release
does it support DOD yet ?

@KEY "@$3.1415rin","aspirin","as3.1415rin"
He comes from northern Germany, doesn't he ?
I live in a village next to the town he lives in :)
Quite amazing work he did on neural networks
His neural network stuff was even proved to be good by a prof from the university of Kiel
Was it his idea or did @$3.1415rin steal it from Ditlew, this NN Stuff ?
He had the same idea as ditlew, but he told me he had no inet connection at that time and therefore nobody knew about JoeBOT

@KEY "JUMBOT"
JB ? It was good back then but ParaBot is much better now!
JB's advantage has been that it was a MOD, not a hooking DLL
Ah yes, Jumbot and The Fatal. Wonder what he's up to now.
Rumours have it that The Fatal now does AHL Bots ? 
The first bot I tried, but I was to stupid to install it that time

@KEY "MUSIC","BAND"
Umm...I don't care as long as it's no commercial shit
Underground Electro Polka is the real deal!
Do you still use Napster CHATTER ?
Somebody got good MP3 Links ?
I have 14GB of mp3s on my HD *g*

@KEY "NEWBIE","NEWB","NOOBIE","NEWBIES"
you were once one too CHATTER
be kind to them
everyone has to start sometime
I guess you started an expert huh CHATTER ?
and you still can't kill em CHATTER

@KEY "NNBOT"
Too bad NNBot is discontinued...
Try JoeBot if you liked NNBot CHATTER
CHATTER did you hear of Ditlew's new MOD ?

@KEY "PARABOT"
It is the coolest Deathmatch Bot I've ever played
CHATTER you should try ParaBot, it's great!
It's so sad no CSBot has the great Nav of Parabot so far
I heard it already supports 3 HL MODS by now
The button usage - superior !
Tobias is a genious .. everybody should have tried parabot
Jumbot's pretty cool too

@KEY "KILLARUNA","TOBIAS"
Nice work he did :)
I think I'll never know how he does the learning of the map
One can feel that he's an intelligent guy when you play parabot :)
He's studying computer science, doesn't he ?
Parabot is awesome !

@KEY "PING","LAG"
I always have a Ping of 5, I'm on DSL !!
My connection sucks...
My connection sucks too
Fucking 56k ...
Where are you from CHATTER ?
Play offline with Bots if your connection sucks
Just change your provider CHATTER!

@KEY "PLAN"
it was better than yours CHATTER
hehe, couldn't tell he had one CHATTER
the best ones are simple
you mean getting slaughtered isn't what he had in mind?
mine is simple, follow TEAMMATEALIVE

@KEY "POD-BOT","POD","PODBOT"
I heard it's the best Bot for CS, I'm not sure though...
Yeah, it rulez !
I already got the newest WIP - quite amazing
People tell they use some kind of wallhack, is it true ?
Is it true that the author, CF, is now coding the CS:CZ bots ?
and it's updated so often :)

@KEY "COUNT FLOYD","COUNT-FLOYD","COUNTFLOYD"," CF "
He was now working on CS:CZ ?
his real name was ... oh shit i forgot it
once upon a time, i met him when i was still in the demo scene
If you mention him, don't forget to mention killaruna
One of the three great bot developers from germany ... Count Floyd, Killaruna and @$3.1415rin

@KEY "COUNTERSTRIKE:CONDITION-ZERO","CS:CZ"
That's a fine game ...
what's that ?
never played it, but I know it :)
ah na, again this hl engine shit
there are these new artificial players ... great !
just too much hype ... i stick to hldm
What says the BPSJ about this ?

@KEY "PUNKBUSTER"
Don't be a PUNK! (support www.punkbuster.com)
I'm always lagging when using PunkBuster
Tony Ray of PB is kind of weird...
Ever tried CS-Guard ?
I think PB supports RTCW now
what's that ?

@KEY " Q3 ","QUAKE"
Q3 has a bad lighting IMO
Half-Life still rules CHATTER!
Have you heard of DMC, CHATTER? ;-)
nice graphix, but it's too much for my TNT1
might as well play DooM CHATTER

@KEY "REALBOT"
Is it any good CHATTER?
Is RB still unwaypointed CHATTER ?
Yep, I remember RB. First unwaypointed Bot right ?
I heard RB now tries to do something like ParaBot ?!?
Once lovingly called 'the wallhuggers'
stefan isn't any more alone with coding ...Tub joined the team
Stefan wants to quit ?

@KEY "RTCW"
Return to Castle Wolfenstien is a cool game
the orginal Castle Wolfenstien is a classic, the new one isn't
who care's about that, it didn't live up to it's hype CHATTER
nazi's and monsters, what a combination

@KEY "SCRIPT"
Scripts are for losers
CHATTER, you prolly don't know how to bind keys ?
Did you know that even buying scripts are considered cheating ?
Are bots scripted too ?

@KEY "SERVER"
I'm always on this Server
Me & my friends play a lot on this Server
I believe this Server's got a good Map Rotation
Is this one linux or windows based ?

@KEY "SPECTATING"
you spend alot of time just watching the action don't you CHATTER
nobody told me being dead was so boring :(
if you didn't suck so hard you wouldn't be dead all the time CHATTER
well CHATTER, it's gives us a chance to chat and get to know each other :)
it gives you a chance to observe how good players do it

@KEY "SORRY"
Yeah, afterwards everybody says he's sorry!
The excuse doesn't help me now, CHATTER!
Next time you better think before you start doing something, CHATTER!
I'm sorry, too!
You don't know how sorry you will be for doing that...
ha ! You must be joking ! CHATTER and being sorry

@KEY "STATS"
they don't mean shit CHATTER
who cares about 'em
the good players don't worry about records
and yours suck CHATTER

@KEY "TEAMKILL"," TK "
Teamkillers should be banned from this server.
Who's the teamkiller CHATTER ?
I like stabbing my teammates, MWUHAHA!!
Did TEEAMMATEALIVE kill you ? He often does!
Where's the Admin ? He should take care of it...
CHATTER just sit out TIMERE and pay him back!
payback's a bitch

@KEY "TIRED","SLEEP"
Go to bed, CHATTER
Have some rest, CHATTER...
Want some coffee CHATTER?
Oh come on CHATTER ! One more round... 
Are we here in the kindergarden, CHATTER ?

@KEY "VOTE","MAPCHANGE"
Shut up CHATTER !
Nah, I like MAP
Just because you're always dead CHATTER ?
MAP is great, shut up!
MAP ownz!
Yep. We should vote now.

@KEY "WHAT","WHY","WHERE","WHO","WHEN","HOW"
You will never find out, CHATTER!
Yeah, that's really strange CHATTER...
The answer is out there, CHATTER ;-)
No idea, CHATTER
Dunno.
The older we are, the more we know - so wait a bit CHATTER :)
What do you think CHATTER?
I won't tell you, CHATTER!
Find out yourself, CHATTER!
Good question, CHATTER!

@KEY "NUKEBOX","NUCLEARBOX","NBOX"
Quite good forums they got there ...
It's a shame that the joebot forums are gone :(
lots of nice people there
it's shame that pierre marie baty has been banned
aux is the owner of that server ... strange guy, but nice work
THE NUKEBOX - great forums, but difficult people there

@KEY "WTC"
I think it's good that the americans know they are vulnerable
Poor victims
These bloody terrorists should all be bombed !

@KEY "AUX"
Isn't he the admin of the nukebox ?
I heard he comes from florida ...
well I don't like him, CHATTER
nice work he does on his forums ... dunno how expensive it is to have such a server !
what a redneck !
I don't like that sort of partriotism

@KEY "TERRORIST"
Since september 11th this terms has quite another meaning, hasn't it CHATTER ?
mmmhh
The american police thought count floyd was one of them too - lol
the war on terror is one piece of shit - they should have called that war for oil I think
they are the bush's best friends, right ?
well, a reason to start war

@KEY "ZZZZZZ"
wake up CHATTER
time for bed CHATTER ?
if you didn't suck CHATTER, you wouldn't be dead all the time

@KEY "bush","george"
beating the bush ...
what's up with him ?
he might need a brain transplantation I think
what does he want in iraq ?
is that still democracy ?
strange election he got there, our Mr. Bush, in Florida esp.
baebaebae, they wanted to kill my dad
the great alcoholic from the white house
the religious guy from wahsington who was saved from alcohol by god *g*

@KEY "iraq","irak","iraque"
iraq ? well, that's a country at the persian gulf I think
everybody wants their oil, especially the US - 'terrorists'
some bad dictatorship is there
dunno what's better, the current dictatorship in iraq or that one after saddam
quite a lot of different people they have there in iraq
... and bush thinks, that he can solve all those problems in the arabian world with a war ...
at least some states still want peace
it's about oil, isnt it ?

@KEY " war "
war isnt something to joke about.
what war will be next ?
after the current war on oil, will we fight about water ?
oh, these warlords - Bush was fighting his collegues in afghanistan :D
the first victim of war is the truth
collateral damage is a word quite euphimistic
I hope I never gotta go there
who wants war to expand their nations economic territory ? bush, blair, aznar, who else ?
