# VSM : Momentum for changing direction
# REA : Reaction time
# STH : values over 90 mean they don't have to estimate ur position, but the know the exact position
# ITP : Instant turn probability
# DIS : distance to overlook instantly		// at bots with sniper weapons this is 2 times
# TPD : milliseconds it takes to look further 1000 units
# PDI : distance to overlook instantly									|| prone
# PTD : milliseconds it takes to look further 1000 units						|| prone
# REC : Amount of recoil when the bot should stop shooting for some short time ( amount is tan(RecoilAngle) * fEnemyDistance )
#
# Note that PDI and PTD are added to the normal delay DIS and TPD
