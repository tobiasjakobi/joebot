    Introduction:</u></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This program 
    is designed to create .ptt - pattern files for training the combat artificial 
    neural network of the JoeBOT. You can train nets within the program as well, 
    but this can be done from the HL-console, too. First of all I'll start with 
    a little theory about ANNs.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>2. 
    Some theory:</u></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The combat 
    net of the JoeBOT is a 6-n-n-5 feedforward network. It is trained with backpropagation. 
    ( + flat spot elimination )<br>
    Every ANN is based on some artificial neurons. Their example are biological 
    neurons, but they have been dramatically simplyfied, to get a good performance 
    on computers and to make the math behind it all simpler. In this ANN the neurons 
    are organized in layer, whereas there are different types of Layers :<br>
    1. The input layer : The input for the neural network is set here.<br>
    2. The hidden layers : They extend the capabilities of the neural net ( There 
    has not to be a hidden layer )<br>
    3. The output layer : The output layer provides the calculated output of the 
    whole neural network.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    Every artificial neuron has like the biological ones inputs and outputs. There 
    are connected among each other. These connections have a weight, i.e. some 
    inputs are more important for the neuron. When the net is propagated, that 
    means, when there is an input at the input layer and these signals are transmitted 
    via the weighted connections to the next layer. The neurons there add all 
    their inputs regarding the weight of the related connections, process the 
    activation function where the bias of each neuron plays an important role 
    and at last the activation is given to the output function ( often an identical 
    function f(x) = x ) and this output is transmitted via the connections to 
    the next neurons ... and so on. This is the so called recall phase.<br>
    The other very important phase is the learning phase. Here the net gets it 
    knowledge. To train this net, I use a supervised learning algorithm, backpropagation.<br>
    You give input pattern to the neural network and you provide the related output 
    pattern as well. The task of the learning algorithm is now to change the weigths 
    and the biases within the net to reach the optimum, where the propagated input 
    is the same as the wanted output.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this 
    program you can edit these pattern the net has to learn.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a 
    combat net : ( in this case a 6-7-7-5 net )<br>

  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><u>How 
    to use the program :</u></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><center><img src="patteredit.gif" width="707" height="468"></center><i><b>Apply 
    changes :</b></i> ...<br>
    <b><i>Propagate : </i></b>you can define a input for the net in <i>'inputs' 
    </i> . This is given to the nn and it calculates the output. This function 
    is just to test how the net reacts on unknown pattern</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>Load 
    Pattern : </b></i>Loads pattern from NNtrain.ptt.<br>
    <i><b>Save Pattern :</b></i> Saves pattern to NNTrain.ptt.<br>
    <i><b>Save as Text :</b></i> Saves this text as NNTrain.pta in a from humans 
    readable format.<br>
    <b><i>Add Pattern :</i></b> ....<br>
    <b><i>Delete Pattern :</i></b> ....<br>
    <b><i>Reset NN :</i></b> Sets all weight of the net ( connection weights and 
    biases ) to random values.<br>
    <b><i>Train NN :</i></b> Trains the NN with the given pattern to the defined 
    maximum error per pattern. Backpropagation is an interative algorithm, therefore 
    all pattern have to be trained for more than one time. When training all pattern 
    once, this is called one epoch. When the number of epochs is bigger than the 
    <i>'epochs to R'</i> the net is resetted and the training begins new.<br>
    <b><i>Save NN :</i></b> saves net to nn.br2 .... u can replace the one in 
    cstrike/joebot/ when u think u trained a good net<br>
    <b><i>Load NN :</i></b> ....<br>
    <i><b>Exit :</b> </i>.... ;)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b><u>Additional 
    Information :</u></b></i><br>
    All Inputs to the NN in the game are values between -1 and 1. For example 
    the tactics entry : The output in the bot is only seen as active when it's 
    over .75. So when you define a pattern and the bot shouldn't really hide, 
    use +none, which means -1. only none is just 0 which should be sufficient 
    in most situations, too.<br>
    The errors of each pattern while the training process is stored in learnlog.html. 
    There you can see which pattern the net was not able to learn.</font></p>
